# Rachel Pastreich Intern Project

For my UPE intern project, I decided to redo the UI/UX and the front-end development of the Upsilon Pi Epsilon (UPE) website. The goal was to create a more user-friendly and visually appealing interface, enhancing the overall user experience for members and visitors.
